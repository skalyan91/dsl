#+TITLE: SG PDPA DBNO

This is the future home of the L4 rules regarding the PDPA, at first just the notification obligation and subsequently the whole thing.

* Abductive Planner                                               :challenge:

** "how do I get out of this?"

Under what circumstances do I not have to notify an individual about a data breach?

*** Answer

1. the data breach is assessed as not notifiable
2. previously taken action to mitigate
3. currently taking action to mitigate
4. PDPC instructed to not notify, after we specifically requested
5. PDPC instructed to not notify, even though we didn't request

8. /are there any others?/

* Web App User Interface                                          :challenge:

Guide the end-user through a Q&A where they can fill in values for the "ground terms" in an L4 ruleset.

Dynamically reduce the interview based on previous input so as to hide irrelevant subtrees.

Give an answer as soon as an answer is justifiable.

Give an explanation that justifies the answer.

* Derive the Web App UI from an Upstream Representation           :challenge:

A possible sequence:

- L4 Spreadsheet :: edited by hand with some drafting support in google sheets
- parser into L4 AST :: HS, PS, other
- transpilation to a planner backend :: Clingo? Other Prolog? Z3? UPPAAL?
- run the planner :: without needing to actually physically click on some UI
- translate the answers back to natural language :: possibly using GF?
- display the answers :: back to the user in the web UI
