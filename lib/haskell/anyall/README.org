#+TITLE: Yet Another AnyAll Library

The And/Or Tree is a classic data structure in CS.

Our implementation equips it with
- a visualization engine (SVG)
- a natural language target producing traditional conjunctive and disjunctive lists
- a reduction calculus that paints elements of the tree

* Reduction Calculus



* Consumers of this library

* Things we were not smart enough to do

** use actual Data.Tree

** use Trees That Grow
