-- Common utilities
{-
  The idea is that given a (MonadError s m) and a monoid (a :: Type), we want
  to operate on (m a :: Type) as if it were also a monoid.
  Here, we often take (m = Either (Doc ann)) and (a = Maybe (Doc ann)) and we
  want to utilize the (<>) and mempty of (Maybe (Doc ann)), lifted up into
  the Either.

  Suppose (m :: Type -> Type) is a type constructor and (a :: Type) is a monoid.
  Then Data.Monoid defines (newtype Ap m a) which lifts the monoid structure of
  a up into the applicative m.
  More concretely, (Ap m :: Type -> Type) inherits both the applicative
  structure of m and the monoid structure of its input type argument, with:
  - (<>) = liftA2 (<>)
  - mempty = pure mempty
  Moreover, if m is also a monad, then (Ap m) also inherits this monad
  structure.
  The standalone deriving via thing below enables (Ap m) to inherit the
  MonadError instance of m should m also be a MonadError.

  TODO:
  Note that for (m = Either s), the monoid structure of (Ap m a) is
  a bit stupid in that Lefts are left-absorbing under (<>), that is
    Ap (Left x) <> Ap _ = Ap (Left x)
  Thus it may be better to use (m a) directly and manually define a monoid
  structure for that rather than use (Ap m a).
