//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,Consider a very simple rule:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,"   A person who –
    (a) walks; and
    (b) (i)   eats, or
           (ii) drinks,
    must sing.",,,,"from Matthew Waddington

//,How would we say this in L4? Like this:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,EVERY,Person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,WHO,walks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,AND,,eats,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,OR,drinks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,MUST,sing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"We haven't done too much violence to the original. We've adjusted the ""and"" and ""or"",
added indentation, and uppercased some keywords. What's next?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"Let's add more structure: defined terms, known to programmers as variable definitions.

    Qualifying Person means a person who walks; and eats or drinks.
    Every Qualifying Person must sing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,EVERY,Person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,WHO,,,Qualifies,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,MEANS,walks,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,AND,,eats,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,OR,drinks,,,,,,,,,,
,,MUST,sing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"In the left margin, a button hides and shows the definition of ""Qualifies"".
This makes for easier reading. Programmers call it ""code folding"".
The details are still there, but hidden from view until you want to see them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,Two Rules for the Price of One!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
//,"""Every Person who Qualifies must sing.""
This is the regulative essence of the rule.
The moving parts. The dynamics. Who does what by when? Entities are acting in time.
Regulative rules are drawn like a +.

""A Qualifying Person is one who walks, and eats or drinks.""
This is the constitutive essence of the rule.
The statics. The yes or no logic. Does this thing count as that, for these purposes?
Constitutive rules are drawn like a T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
